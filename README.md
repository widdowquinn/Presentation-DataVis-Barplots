# README.md - Presentation-DataVis-Barplots

These are slides for a presentation on data visualisation, focusing on how bar plots can provide a misleading account of data. The presentation is an adaptation of Christina Bergmann's presentation from the Software Sustainability Institute's Research Data Visualisation Workshop (RDVW), with ideas from Mike Croucher's presentation "Is Your Research Software Correct?"
